# This is a test plan for the sample task. See the README.md next to this file for more details on
# how to write a test plan.

# We define a validator for this subtask. The path is relative to this file
[Subtask 1 - validators/st1.cpp]

  # You can use `copy` to use sample test cases in the test plan. Here we use a glob pattern
  # to copy multiple files in a single command.
  sample ; copy statement/sample-*.in

  # You can also use `copy` to specify manual test cases
  manual ; copy testplan/manual-1.in

  # Use a script to generate a test case programmatically
  rand ; gen_random.py 10 100


# We don't define a validator for this subtask.
[Subtask 2]
  @extends subtask 1

  # You can also write a script in C++, useful to speed up generation.
  rand ; gen_random.cpp -2000000000 2000000000

  # You can use the `echo` command to generate manual cases
  border-case ; echo 2000000000 2000000000
  border-case ; echo -2000000000 -2000000000

  # This shows how to write a multi-test script. Test generated by the script are
  # not very meaningful. It is just meant to show the feature.
