# This file can be used to configure ocimatic. It can be used to set up the commands for
# compiling (and running) source code in the various programming languages supported by
# ocimatic. You can either use commands from your PATH or provide their absolute paths.
# Additionally, you can add extra flags for specific commands.

[cpp]
# Command and flags to compile C++ files. The command should be able to take the -I and -o
# flags. Solutions in C++ are the most common so you better have this properly configured.
command = "g++"
flags = ["-O2", "-std=c++17"]

[python]
# Command to interpret python files. Generator scripts are typically written in python
# so you may want to configure this or otherwise testplans may fail to run.
command = "python3"

[java]
# Commands to compile java files and to run the generated bytecode. Java is only used for
# solutions. Thus, you should be able to use most of ocimatic without this, but you won't
# be able to run solutions in java.
javac = "javac"
jre = "java"

[rust]
# Command and flags to compile rust files. Rust solutions are rare so you may be good without
# configuring this. However, we sometime write checkers in rust.
command = "rustc"
flags = ["--edition=2021", "-O"]
